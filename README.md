# 4. Download Database

This is the path to the database file for you to download: [`/admin/database/***.sql`](https://github.com/Denis060/SierraShop/tree/main/admin/database)

Create a new database on **PHPMyAdmin** at your server, then import the .sql file that you just downloaded.

# 5. Quick Start Guide

Clone the project to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denis060/SierraShop.git
cd SierraShop
```

Copy the .env.example file to .env:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Run composer install:

```bash
composer install
```

# 6. Installation instructions

After running the above command, you need to edit the following information in the **.env** file:

## 6.1 Edit Config

You need to change the path in the '**.env**' file to match the location of this source code on your server and must match the domain you registered.

```dotenv
PATH_URL=/
PATH_URL_IMG=public/upload/images/
PATH_URL_IMG_PRODUCT=public/upload/products/
```

> **Note:**
> 
> The path of the config file that is using these environment variables is located at: [`/lib/config/config.php`](https://github.com/Denis060/SierraShop/tree/main/lib/config/config.php)

## 6.2 Edit Connect Database

You need to change the connection information and import sql file to the database after you have cloned my repository so that the website can work.

This is the path to the sql file for you to import to your database:
[`/admin/database/***.sql`](https://github.com/Denis060/SierraShop/tree/main/admin/database)

And change the connection information to match your database in .env file:

```dotenv
DB_HOST=db_server
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=root
DB_NAME=new_mvc_shop_db
```

> **Note:**
>
> The path of the database config file that is using these environment variables is located at: [`/lib/config/database.php`](https://github.com/Denis060/SierraShop/tree/main/lib/config/database.php)

## 6.3 Edit .htaccess

Change RewriteBase - Recommend the path that matches your host address.

So we will have:
```
RewriteBase /
```

---

> **Note**: This applies to the case where your project is in a subfolder, and you want it accessible from a subpath URL.
>
>**EXAMPLE**:
>```
>http://localhost/new-mvc-shop/
>``` 
> So we will have:
> ```
> RewriteBase /new-mvc-shop/
> ```

## 6.4 Email Configuration (Enhanced)

> **Enhanced Email System with Automatic Failover**
> 
SierraShop now includes an improved email system with automatic failover support for better reliability.

Update the following information in the **.env** file:

```dotenv
# Primary SMTP Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_UNAME=your_primary_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PWORD=your_app_password

# Fallback SMTP Configuration (Optional but recommended)
SMTP_HOST_FALLBACK=smtp-mail.outlook.com
SMTP_PORT_FALLBACK=587
SMTP_UNAME_FALLBACK=your_backup_email@outlook.com
SMTP_PWORD_FALLBACK=your_backup_password
```

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Failover**: If primary SMTP fails, system automatically tries fallback
- **Enhanced Security**: TLS encryption and secure authentication
- **Better Error Handling**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Multiple Provider Support**: Gmail, Outlook, and other SMTP providers

**Gmail Setup Tips:**
1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate app-specific password: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833
3. Use the app password as SMTP_PWORD

> **Note:**
>
> The enhanced email configuration files are located at:
> - Primary config: [`/lib/config/sendmail.php`](lib/config/sendmail.php)
> - Email helper: [`/lib/email_helper.php`](lib/email_helper.php)
